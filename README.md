# Car-price-prediction---Machine-Learning
Car price prediction Machine Learning --- Which is used to predict the price of used cars based on the features.


# Problem Statement:
Objective:
  Aim is to enhance the customer experience and streamline the pricing process by leveraging machine learning. Create an accurate and user-friendly streamlit tool that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. This tool should be deployed as an interactive web application for both customers and sales representatives to use seamlessly.

# Project Scope:
Build a model based on historical data including various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes from different cities. Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on these features. The model should be integrated into a Streamlit-based web application to allow users to input car details and receive an estimated price instantly.
